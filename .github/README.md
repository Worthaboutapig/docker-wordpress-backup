# Docker Wordpress Backup

This script is meant to automatically backup your wordpress site and database.

It will work out of the box if you use our environment:

- proxy:
https://github.com/evertramos/docker-compose-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion

- wordpress:
https://github.com/evertramos/docker-wordpress-letsencrypt

If you don't... you might want to check it out! But still this script can be configured to your environment as well.
